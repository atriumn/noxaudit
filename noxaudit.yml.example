# Which focus area runs on which day
# Values can be: a single name, a list (grouped into one API call), or "all"
#
# Grouping saves ~80% on input tokens by deduplicating source files:
#   6 separate runs: ~$5/week    1 combined run: ~$1/week
#
# Examples:
#   monday: security                   # single focus
#   monday: [security, dependencies]   # grouped (one API call, files deduped)
#   monday: all                        # all 7 focus areas in one call
schedule:
  monday: security
  tuesday: patterns
  wednesday: docs
  thursday: hygiene
  friday: performance
  saturday: dependencies
