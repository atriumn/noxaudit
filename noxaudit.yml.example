# Noxaudit configuration

# Frame-based schedule (preferred)
# Frames are the five organizing lenses for code quality:
#   does_it_work        → security, testing
#   does_it_feel_right  → (Phase 2: ux-copy, help-content)
#   can_everyone_use_it → (Phase 2: a11y)
#   does_it_last        → patterns, hygiene, docs, dependencies
#   can_we_prove_it     → performance
#
# You can also use individual focus area names (backward compatible):
#   monday: security                   # single focus area
#   monday: [security, dependencies]   # grouped (one API call, files deduped)
#   monday: all                        # all 7 focus areas in one call
schedule:
  monday: does_it_work        # → security + testing
  tuesday: does_it_last       # → patterns + hygiene + docs + dependencies
  wednesday: does_it_work     # second run this week
  thursday: does_it_last
  friday: can_we_prove_it     # → performance
  saturday: off
  sunday: off

# Optional: override which focus areas are active within a frame

#   does_it_last:
#     patterns: true
#     hygiene: true
#     docs: true
#     dependencies: false     # skip dependency audits
